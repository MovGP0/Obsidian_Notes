## Audio Sampling

- The sample rate of the data 
    - 44.1 kHz on audio CD
    - 88.1 or 96 kHz for professional sampling
    - 176.4 or 192 kHz when heavy post production is required

- The bit resolution of the data
    - 8 bit (int) for low quality
    - 16 bit (int) for audio CD
    - 24 bit (int) or 32 bit (double) for professional sampling
