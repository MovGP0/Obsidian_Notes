Use **Submodules** if
- You need clear separation between repositories.
- The submodule is maintained independently.
- You want to keep the main repository size smaller.

Use **Subtrees** if
- You prefer a simpler workflow.
- You want to integrate the history of the sub-repo with the main repo.
- You don't mind the main repository becoming larger.
