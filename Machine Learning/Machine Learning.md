- Basic idea is function approximation
- a Language Model is statistical model to represent the probability of a word following a set of previous words

Function approximation can be done using
- [Fourier Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series)
- [Taylor Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series)
- [Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network)
