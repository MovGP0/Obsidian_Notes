The **Model Context Protocol** (**MCP**) is an open standard developed by Anthropic for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources through a single interface.

## Configuring MCP Severs

MCP Servers can be usually configured using a JSON file. 

**Examples**

Simple example that adds an MCP server that is started with a shell command:
```json
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "note": "Repomix STDIO Server",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [ "-y", "repomix", "--mcp" ]
    },
```

The same tool but executed via a [[Docker]] container:
```json
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "note": "Repomix Docker Container",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run","-i","--rm","ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix","--mcp"]
    }
  }
```

It's also possible to specify environment variables:
```json
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-atlassian": {
      "note": "Atlassian Docker Container",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "JIRA_URL",
        "-e",
        "JIRA_USERNAME",
        "-e",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CONFLUENCE_URL": "https://your-company.atlassian.net/wiki",
        "CONFLUENCE_USERNAME": "your.email@company.com",
        "CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN": "your_confluence_api_token",
        "JIRA_URL": "xxx.atlassian.net",
        "JIRA_USERNAME": "your.email@company.com",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "xxx"
      },
    }
  }
```

Another possibility is to use a URL to the server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-sse": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://my-localhost:8080/repomix/mcp",
      "note": "Repomix MCP Server"
    }
  }
}
```

> [!Note]
> The `type` parameter is one of 
> - `stdio` (default)
> 	- uses the `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` streams of the operating system
> - `sse` (obsolete) 
> 	- uses HTTP + [[Server-Sent Events (SSE)|SSE]] transport
> 	- Response `content-type` header is either `text/event-stream` or `application/json`
> - `streamable-http` 
> 	- like `sse`, but supports session continuations (stateless servers) for improved scalability
> 	- `Last-Event-ID` and `Mcp-Session-Id` HTTP-Headers are used to resume conversations

> [!Note]
> The exact syntax might be different dependent on the tool that the configuration is for.

## Configure MCP Clients

> [!Note]
> Some clients may require an subscription for MCP to be supported
