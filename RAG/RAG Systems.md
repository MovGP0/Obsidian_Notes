## Advantages of RAG systems

- **Improved informativeness** by generating output that is more relevant to the user
- **Enhanced accuracy** more factual correct information by relying on verified information

## Main Components

- **Retrieval** 
	- identifies and extracts relevant information from knowledge sources like documents, databases, or knowledge graphs
	- uses keyword search, semantic search, or vector-based similarity search
- **Generation**
	- searches information that is relevant to the user query 
	- generates text output based on the input prompt and the retrieved information
- **Fusion**
	- generating the output that is shown to the user, i.e. by summarizing using a large language model (LLM) or concatenating with the retrieved data from the databases
