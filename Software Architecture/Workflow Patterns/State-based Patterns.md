## Deferred Choice

Choise which branch needs to be executed next is presented to the user after task has returned a result.

## Interleaved Parallel Routing

Semaphore makes sure that tasks are not executed at the same time without enforcing a particular order.

## Milestone

State of another branch is only updated when current branch is in a specific/valid state.

## Critical Section

Processing of the branch needs to be continued when cancelled (or reversed as a whole).

## Interleaved Routing

Each member of a set of tasks must be executed once.

They can be executed in any order but no two tasks can be executed at the same time.
