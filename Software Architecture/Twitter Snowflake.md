Twitter Snowflake is a distributed, unique ID generation system designed to generate unique, time-ordered, 64-bit IDs at a high rate across multiple nodes. It is named "Snowflake" due to the IDs it generates being unique and time-ordered, like the characteristics of a snowflake.

The 64-bit ID generated by Snowflake is structured as follows:

1.  Timestamp (41 bits): This represents the time (in milliseconds) since a custom epoch, usually set to a specific point in time when the system was introduced. With 41 bits, it can represent time for approximately 69 years.
2.  Node/worker ID (10 bits): This is a unique identifier for the specific node or worker generating the ID. The 10 bits allow for 1024 unique nodes/workers.
3.  Sequence number (12 bits): This is a per-node counter that resets every millisecond, allowing for 4096 unique IDs per node per millisecond.

Here's how Twitter Snowflake works:

1.  Each node or worker in the distributed system is assigned a unique node/worker ID.
2.  When a new ID is requested, the current timestamp is fetched, and the difference between the current time and the custom epoch is calculated.
3.  The timestamp, node/worker ID, and the sequence number are combined into a single 64-bit integer. The timestamp occupies the most significant bits, followed by the node/worker ID, and finally, the sequence number.
4.  If multiple IDs are requested within the same millisecond, the sequence number is incremented to ensure uniqueness.

This approach allows Twitter Snowflake to generate unique, time-ordered IDs at a high rate across multiple nodes without coordination, and it ensures that the IDs are sortable based on their creation time.
