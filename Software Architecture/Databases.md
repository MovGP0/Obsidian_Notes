| [[Relational Databases]]  | Use when you need ACID compliance, complex queries, and structured data with relationships.                    |
| [[Wide-Column Store]]     | Use for handling large-scale data with high write and read throughput, often in distributed systems.           |
| [[Document databases]]    | Use for semi-structured data, flexible schema, and hierarchical data representations.                          |
| [[Graph Databases]]       | Use for data with complex relationships and networks, such as social networks and recommendation engines.      |
| [[Vector Databases]]      | Use for storing and querying high-dimensional vector data, often used in machine learning and AI applications. |
| [[Search Databases]]      | Use for full-text search and complex text-based queries, providing fast search capabilities.                   |
| [[Key-Value Databases]]   | Use for simple, fast, and scalable key-based lookups with minimal query complexity.                            |
| [[Time-Series Databases]] | Use for time-stamped data, optimized for time-based queries, and handling high write throughput.               |
