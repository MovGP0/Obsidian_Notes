The Pipeline Pattern is a design pattern where data flows through a sequence of tasks or stages. 

Each stage operates concurrently with the others, and each stage processes the data as it arrives and then passes it to the next stage. 

This pattern is useful when you have a sequence of operations that can be performed in parallel and the output of one operation is the input to the next operation.
