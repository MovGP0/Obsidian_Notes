- measuring the performance of the application reduces the performance of the application
	- do not use debugger or profiles while measuring the performance
- measuring the performance in `Debug` instead of `Release` reduces the performance of the application
- different compiler versions do different optimizations that can effect performance
	- unrolling of loops
	- inlining (consider `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions)]`)
	- removing code that is not used in benchmark
	- removing code when return value is not used
	- inlining constants (`Math.Sqt(9)` => `3`)
- other applications might impact the performance of the test
- energy saving mode reduces the performance of the application
- consider multiple runs and collect statistics/distribution because of random noise
- consider differend data sizes to measure scalability
- cold start (first run) can result in different performance (ie. caching, JIT). Create dedicated benchmarks for cold start and hot state
- fast methods need to be executed/invoked many times to reduce the variation in the time measurements
- Security updates in the Runtime or OS might reduce performance
