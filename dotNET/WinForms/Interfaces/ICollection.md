## Differences between ICollection and ICollection&lt;T&gt;

- **Type-Safety**: `ICollection<T>` is type-safe. This means that you can only add, remove, or retrieve elements of a specific type from the collection. This can prevent a whole class of bugs related to incorrect types. `ICollection`, on the other hand, can hold any object, but you must cast objects to the correct type when you retrieve them.
- **Performance**: Because `ICollection` is not type-safe, it requires boxing and unboxing when you store and retrieve value types (like `int`, `double`, `bool`, etc.). This can have a significant performance impact if you're dealing with large collections or high-performance code. `ICollection<T>` does not require boxing or unboxing, so it can be more efficient.
- **Methods and Properties**: Both interfaces provide similar functionalities. They allow you to add and remove items, clear the collection, check if an item exists in the collection, copy the collection to an array, and get the number of items. However, `ICollection<T>` has a property `IsReadOnly` to check if the collection is read-only.

## SyncRoot and IsSynchronized

The `SyncRoot` and `IsSynchronized` properties are part of the non-generic `ICollection` interface in .NET, and are designed to provide some support for making collections thread-safe. However, they have some important limitations and are generally not recommended for use in new code.

- `IsSynchronized`: This property is supposed to indicate whether the collection is thread-safe. If it's `true`, the collection is thread-safe; if it's `false`, it's not. However, it's important to note that most collections return `false` for this property, including collections from `System.Collections.Concurrent` namespace which are designed to be thread-safe.

- `SyncRoot`: This property provides an object that can be used to synchronize access to the collection. The idea is that you would lock on this object before accessing the collection to ensure that only one thread can access it at a time. However, this approach has several problems. One major problem is that it doesn't prevent other code from accessing the collection without obtaining the lock, which can still lead to race conditions.

Usage:
```csharp
ICollection collection = ...;

lock (collection.SyncRoot)
{
    // Access the collection
}
```

In modern .NET programming, it's generally better to use the collections from the `System.Collections.Concurrent` namespace for thread-safe operations, or to use higher-level synchronization primitives like `lock` statements, `Monitor`, `Mutex`, `Semaphore`, `ReaderWriterLockSlim`, or `async`/`await` with `SemaphoreSlim`.

Remember that `IsSynchronized` and `SyncRoot` are not part of the generic `ICollection<T>` interface. This reflects the general move away from their use in modern .NET programming.

## Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MyCollection : IEnumerable<int>, ICollection<int>
{
    private List<int> _list = new List<int>();

    public int Count => _list.Count;

    public bool IsReadOnly => false;

    public void Add(int item)
    {
        _list.Add(item);
    }

    public void Clear()
    {
        _list.Clear();
    }

    public bool Contains(int item)
    {
        return _list.Contains(item);
    }

    public void CopyTo(int[] array, int arrayIndex)
    {
        _list.CopyTo(array, arrayIndex);
    }

    public IEnumerator<int> GetEnumerator()
    {
        return _list.GetEnumerator();
    }

    public bool Remove(int item)
    {
        return _list.Remove(item);
    }

    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
    {
        return _list.GetEnumerator();
    }
}
```
