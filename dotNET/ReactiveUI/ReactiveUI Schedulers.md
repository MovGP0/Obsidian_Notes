## Schedulers in `System.Reactive.Concurrency`

| Scheduler Factory       | Class               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheduler.CurrentThread |                     | - Executes work on the current thread using a trampoline to ensure the order of actions.<br>- Useful for work that should happen on the current thread but may need to be queued if there are existing actions.<br>- Use when tasks must run sequentially on the current thread but should avoid blocking during queuing.                           |
| Scheduler.Immediate     | ImmediateScheduler  | - Executes actions immediately without any scheduling.<br>- Useful when you need to execute the work right away in the current call stack.<br>- Use for tasks that should be executed synchronously within the current call stack without delay.                                                                                                    |
| Scheduler.NewThread     | NewThreadScheduler  | - Schedules work on a new thread.<br>- This can be useful when you need to isolate the work on a completely new thread, but it can be costly since it creates a new thread each time.<br>- Use when tasks need to run independently without sharing the thread context but be mindful of the cost of thread creation.                               |
| Scheduler.Now           |                     | - Represents the current notion of time for the scheduler.<br>- Use when tasks need to be scheduled based on a specific current time value for accurate timing reference.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Scheduler.TaskPool      | TaskPoolScheduler   | - Uses `Task.Factory.StartNew` for scheduling work, allowing tasks to be run asynchronously on the task pool.<br>- Useful for working with the TPL more directly when integrating with observables.<br>- Use when tasks can leverage the flexibility of the task pool, especially when integrating with TPL and managing multiple concurrent tasks. |
| Scheduler.ThreadPool    | ThreadPoolScheduler | - Uses the .NET thread pool to schedule work.<br>- It provides a way to execute actions using pooled threads, which is more efficient than creating new threads.<br>- Use for lightweight tasks that benefit from pooled threads rather than creating new threads repeatedly.                                                                       |
|                         | ControlScheduler    | (WinForms)<br>- Schedules work on the message loop associated with a Windows Forms control.<br>- Use for operations that need to update the UI of a WinForms application, ensuring thread-safe access.                                                                                                                                              |
|                         | DispatcherScheduler | (WPF, Silverlight)<br>- Schedules work on a Dispatcher, managing tasks on the UI thread.<br>- Use for operations needing safe interaction with WPF or Silverlight UI elements on their message loop.                                                                                                                                                |
|                         | EventLoopScheduler  | - Creates a dedicated thread that runs an event loop, which can be used to execute scheduled actions serially.<br>- This can be useful when needing a serialized execution context without blocking the UI or the main thread.                                                                                                                      |
|                         | HistoricalScheduler | - Provides a virtual time scheduler using DateTimeOffset and TimeSpan for flexible timing.<br>- Use for testing or simulating time-based operations in a controlled, deterministic environment.                                                                                                                                                     |
