An agent is defined by

- ***Autonomy**: The degree to which the agent acts without human intervention or supervision.
- **Social Ability**: How the agent interacts with other agents.
- **Reactivity**: How the agent *perceives* it's environment and takes *actions* in response.
- **Proactivity**: The agent doesn't just react, but forms goals and persues them on its own.

> Any agent capable of adapting to a sufficiently large set of **distributional shifts**
> must have learned a **causal model** of the data generating process.

- **distributional shifts**: are a change in the environment (i.e. driving on a road in summer vs. in winter)
- **causal model**: understanding the cause-and-effect relationships (i.e. physics) of the environment (i.e. represented by a **causual bayesian network**)
