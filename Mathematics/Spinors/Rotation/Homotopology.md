## Homotopic

Two curves are **homotopic** if one can be continuously deformed into the other without cutting or cluing.

> [!Note]
> Two curves are called **homotopic** when they have the same Topology

## Simple-Connectedness

A space is **simply-connected** if all loops living in the space can shrink down to a point whenever they want. No object/hole can be contained in the loops that prevent the loops from shrinking.

When the space forms a cylinder, a curve might wrap around the cylinder, preventing the loop from shrinking. The cylinder is topologically equivalent to a CD-shape, where the hole of the CD represents the inner volume of the cylinder. Thus, a cylinder shaped space is *not simply-connected*. 

## Homotopic classes

A **homotopic class** is defined by the **winding number**, which determines how often a loop is wrapped around a hole that prevents the loop from shrinking.

| Winding Number | Example                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0              | No object contained in the loop                            |
| 1              | The loop contains an object and is wrapped once around it  |
| 2              | The loop contains an object and is wrapped twice around it |
- All loops with the same winding number are *homotopic*
- Loops with different winding numbers are *not homotopic*
