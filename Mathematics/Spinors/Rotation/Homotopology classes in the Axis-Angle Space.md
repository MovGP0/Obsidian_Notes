There are multiple ways how an object can be oriented by subsequent turns back to its original orientation.

Every possible combination of rotations that orient the object back into its original orientation can be represented as a loop. Those loops may have a *winding number* greater than 0, forming different [[Homotopology#Homotopic classes|Homotopic classes]].

[[Vector|Vectors]] are not sensitive to different *Homotopic classes*, while [[Spinors]] are.

When a loop around a spherical space is represented as a circle, the crossings of a loop around the sphere lead to a "teleport" of the loop in the circle representation.

Every loop with an odd number of teleports (1, 3, 5, …) can be transformed in an *homotopic* way into a loop with another odd number of teleports. Every loop with an even number of teleports (0, 2, 4, …)  can be transformed in an *homotopic* way into a loop with another even number of teleports. Therefore, we have two homotopic classes:

- *Class Ⅰ*: the loop teleports an odd number of times
- *Class Ⅱ*: the loop teleports an even number of times
