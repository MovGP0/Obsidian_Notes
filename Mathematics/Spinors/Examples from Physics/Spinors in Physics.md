## Bosons

- Integer Spin
- The particle's intrinsic angular momentum is $n\hbar$, where $n$ is an integer.
- Their wavefunctions are not spinors
- Many particles can occupy the same state at the same time
  (See [[Spin-Statistics-Theorem]])

## Fermions

- Half-Integer Spin
- The particle's intrinsic angular momentum, also known as spin, is $\frac{n}{2}\hbar$, where $n$ is an integer.
- Their wavefunctions are spinors
- Representation by an bispinor field
- Particles can not occupy the same state at the same time
