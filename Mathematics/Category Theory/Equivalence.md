Two groups $C$ and $D$ are equivalent ($C \simeq D$), when they are *natural isomorph*, such that the composition of the functors are *natural isomorph*:

$$G∘F \cong 1_C$$
$$F∘G \cong 1_D$$

The transformations are natural transformation, when there are isomorph transformations between functors, such that:

$$\nu : F \rightarrow G$$
$$\nu^{-1} : G \rightarrow F$$
