If there is a morphism $f : A \rightarrow B$ and another morphism $f^{-1} : B \rightarrow A$, than $f ∘ f^{-1} = I_B$ and $f^{-1} ∘ f = I_A$ are **Isomorphisms**.

If there isomorphisms between two sets $A$ and $B$ exists, then the sets are isomorph (indicated using the operator $\cong$):
$$A \cong B$$
