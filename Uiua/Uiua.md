## Data Types

| **C# Data Type** | **Uiua Equivalent**     | **Notes**                                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `int`            | Number (integer)        | Uiua supports integers as a part of its numeric type.            |
| `float`          | Number (floating-point) | Floating-point numbers are supported in Uiua.                    |
| `double`         | Number (floating-point) | Double precision is included within Uiua's number type.          |
| `decimal`        | Number (floating-point) | Equivalent to a high-precision floating-point number.            |
| `char`           | Character               | Uiua supports individual characters.                             |
| `string`         | Array of Characters     | Strings in Uiua are arrays of characters.                        |
| `bool`           | Not directly supported  | Boolean logic is typically handled via numeric values (0 and 1). |
| `object`         | Box                     | Uiua's box type allows for nested arrays and generic objects.    |
| `array`          | Multidimensional Array  | Arrays are a fundamental part of Uiua.                           |
