| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Vec<T>`         | A contiguous, growable array type that stores data on the heap. Elements are accessed by an index.                                                                       |
| `HashMap<K, V>`  | A generic hash map, implemented as a hash table. It provides fast lookups, insertions, and removals for arbitrary keys.                                                  |
| `BTreeMap<K, V>` | A map based on a B-Tree. It maintains sorted order of the keys and allows efficient iteration, searching, range viewing, and other operations that rely on ordered data. |
| `HashSet<T>`     | A generic set implemented as a hash table. It provides fast operations for inserting, removing, and checking the existence of elements.                                  |
| `BTreeSet<T>`    | A set based on a B-Tree. Similar to BTreeMap but stores values instead of key-value pairs. Maintains sorted order.                                                       |
| `LinkedList<T>`  | A doubly-linked list. Allows for efficient insertions and deletions at both the front and back.                                                                          |
| `VecDeque<T>`    | A double-ended queue implemented with a growable ring buffer. Allows efficient push/pop operations from both front and back.                                             |
| `BinaryHeap<T>`  | A priority queue implemented as a binary heap. Elements can be efficiently pushed and the smallest element can be popped.                                                |

| `Array[T; N]`              | A fixed-size array, which stores data on the stack when N is small. Elements are accessed by an index.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Slice[T]`                 | A dynamically-sized view into a contiguous sequence, either in an array or in a `Vec<T>`.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `Range<T>`                 | A range is a set of values with a beginning and an end, represented as `start..end` or `start..=end`.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Option<T>`                | An enum which can either be `Some(T)` representing an element of type `T`, or `None` representing the absence of an element.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Result<T, E>`             | An enum which is either `Ok(T)`, representing a successful computation, or `Err(E)`, representing a computation that failed.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Cow<B>`                   | A 'clone on write' smart pointer that can either be borrowed (and hence no heap allocation) or owned (requires heap allocation).                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>` | These types provide interior mutability in Rust, which means that they allow you to mutate the value they hold while it is still considered immutable by the Rust compiler. `Cell<T>` works for Copy types and `RefCell<T>` works for all types and checks borrow rules at runtime. |
