The distance between two points in space are measured by

$$dl = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2}$$
$$dl^2 = dx^2 + dt^2$$
The distance between two events in spacetime are measured by the [[Spacetime Interval]]:
$$ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 - c^2dt^2}$$

Note that the time coordinate has an imaginary content:

$$-c^2dt^2 = \left(icdt\right)^2$$
$$ds^2 = \eta_x dx^2 + \eta_t dt^2$$
where $\eta_x = 1$ and $\eta_t = -1$.
