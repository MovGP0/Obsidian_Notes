The **Centenary Einstein Equation (CEE)** is a form of **Einstein's field equations** (EFEs) in general relativity, which describe how matter and energy in the universe determine the curvature of spacetime. 

$$R_{ik} - \frac{1}{2} g_{ik} R - \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{ik(U)} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{ik}$$

- $R_{ik}$ is the **Ricci curvature tensor**.
  Represents how the volume of a small geodesic ball in spacetime deviates from that in flat spacetime. In simpler terms, it encapsulates the local curvature caused by the presence of matter and energy.

- $g_{ik}$ is the metric tensor of spacetime.
  This tensor defines the geometry of spacetime and specifies distances and angles.

- $R$ is the Ricci scalar, a contraction of the Ricci tensor:
    $$R = g^{ik} R_{ik}$$
    It summarizes the overall curvature of spacetime at a given point.

- $T_{ik(U)}$ is the energy-momentum tensor of the universe.
  This represents the energy density, momentum density, and stresses (pressures and shear) of all matter and energy present in the universe, including contributions from fields like the cosmological constant (if applicable). It plays the role of a "universal background energy."

- $T_{ik}$ is the **energy-momentum tensor** of "ordinary" matter and energy.
  This includes contributions from matter (such as dust or perfect fluids), electromagnetic fields, and other local energy-momentum distributions.

- $G$ is The gravitational constant
  It determines the strength of the gravitational interaction in the equations.

- $c$ The speed of light in vacuum

- $\frac{8 \pi G}{c^4}$ is a coupling constant that relates the curvature of spacetime to the energy and momentum of matter.

### Left-Hand Side of the Equation

$$G_{ik} = R_{ik} - \frac{1}{2} g_{ik} R$$

This is the **Einstein tensor**, often denoted as $G_{ik}$. It is derived from the Ricci tensor and scalar and encapsulates the geometric structure of spacetime, describing how it curves in response to energy and momentum.

### Right-Hand Side of the Equation

$$\frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{ik}$$

This term describes the contribution of ordinary matter and energy to the spacetime curvature.

### Additional Term on the Left

$$-\frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{ik(U)}$$

This represents the subtraction of the "background energy-momentum tensor of the universe." Including it allows for a distinction between the total energy-momentum tensor ($T_{ik(U)} + T_{ik}$) and the contributions from local matter and energy ($T_{ik}$).

### Interpretation of the Equation

The equation can be written as:

$$R_{ik} - \frac{1}{2} g_{ik} R = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} (T_{ik} + T_{ik(U)})$$

This states that the curvature of spacetime (left-hand side) is determined by both the energy-momentum tensor of the universe ($T_{ik(U)}$) and local matter and energy ($T_{ik}$).

### Empty Space: $R_{ik} = 0$

In regions of empty space (vacuum, $T_{ik} = 0$ and $T_{ik(U)} = 0$), the Ricci tensor $R_{ik}$ vanishes. This simplifies the equation to:

$R_{ik} = 0$

This represents the condition for spacetime to be "flat" or only influenced by gravitational waves or other non-matter-related structures.
