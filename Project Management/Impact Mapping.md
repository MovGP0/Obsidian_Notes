# Impact Mapping
---
## Why
[SMARTER](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_(Projektmanagement)) goal definition of the Project
- Specific
- Measurable
- Actionable
- Realistic
- Timed
- Ecological/Economic
- Resourced
---
Who/How/What is captured in User Story:
- `As a` player `I want` automated Invites `so that` I can invite friends.
---
## Who
- Primary Actors: whose Goals are fullfilled?
- Secondary Actors: who provides Services?
- Off-Stage Actors: who is interested, but not profiting?
---
## How
- How should Actors behaviour change?
- How can Actors help?
- How can Actors obstuct?
- Focus on business activity; not features
---
## What
What can we do to support the required impacts? 
- Deliverables
- Software features
- Organizational/activity changes
---
## Key reasons IT-Projects fail
- Business reasons
- Business strategy superseeded
- Business processes change
- Poor requirements management
- Business benefits not clearly communicated or overstated
---
## Meetings
Create a visual representation (ie. Mind Map) of the Impact Map

Visual faciliation enables:
- Pacticipation
- Big-picture thingking
- Group memory improves
---
## Communicate Investment - not Cost
Thinking in 'what will it cost' / 'when will it be delivered' prevents iterative development/delivery/learning

---
Ask about: 
- what value provides the given item to the customer
- what deadline has the customer in mind
- how much are the customer willing to invest
---
Identify 
- real goals
- key priorities
- alternatives
---
## Mapping Process
---
### 1. Discover real goals
Business Customers are not technology experts
- goal is required for technogly experts to provide proper solutions.

Technology landscape and business requirements change fast
- once correct assumptions might become invalid
- business goal usually constant
- solutions can be adapted when goal is clear
---
### 2. Define good measurements
[Competitive Engineering from Tom Gilb](https://www.amazon.de/dp/0750665076) defines:
- Scale: what to measure
- Meter: how to measure
- Benchmark: what is the current situation
- Constraint: investment/time (cost)
- Target: desired value (revenue)
---
#### Plan milestones
- define *minimum* requirement that is required for delivery
---
#### Validity Check
- Is the feature contributing to the impact?
- Is the impact valid for the actor?
- Will the feature contribute to the goal?
---
#### Find alternatives
- What else could people do?
- What other feature/process could help?
- What person/process/constraint could obstruct?
---
### 3. Identify key priorities
- Consider possible obstructions
- identify High-Value Low-Effort items
- identify key assumptions to test
---
Use virtual (monopoly) money or dot-voting to prioritize items.

Prioritize impacts / not (software/hardware) features.

---
#### Kano Model
- mandatory (must-have)
- linear (more-is-better)
- exciters (increase statisfaction)
---
#### Purpose Alignment Model
- market-differentiation
- parity (good enough)
- partner (by somewhere else)
- who cares (don't do this)
---
### 4. Earn or Learn
- Consider time for prototyping/experimenting/learning
	- a few days to a week per deliverable
- Deliver and see if it works
    - Failing leads to learning what is really needed
---
- What is the simplest way to support an activity?
- What is the simplest way to test an assumption?
- Can we test a process without software?
- Can we start with a partially manually process?
---
If experimenting is not an option; consider user stories and the [hamburger method](https://gojko.net/2012/01/23/splitting-user-stories-the-hamburger-method/):
- fill the hamburger with features
- remove features until only the most essential features are left
---
## Meeting Considerations
- Measure progress periodically against keystone metrics
- If the delivery fails to archive key targets, rething strategy
- Limit inital meetings to 5 or 6 people
    - Key business and technical stakeholders need to be present
    - Business stakeholders define key objectives and approve solutions
    - Technical stakeholders need to identify feasibility and risks
---
- Split meetings with more people into workgroups
    - Define a dedicated faciliator who is responsile for 
        - coordination between workgroups
        - keeps track of time
        - prevent people from pushing their personal agenda too much
---
### Meeting Pitfalls
- first come up with a range of solutions (divergence) then criticize (converge)
	- don't critizize too early
 - opinionated senior decision-makers who drive their agenda
    - make a group effort where people work together
- don't waste time to fully map all items
    - work out alternatives first
- don't waste time specifying low-level details
---
### Impact Mapping Pitfalls
- Jumper: Skips levels in the mapping process
- Astronaut: maps goals and impacts without metrics
- Surealist: unrealistic or non-actionable metrics
- Shopper: too much details early-on
- Optimist: focusing only on statisfying users need without considering obstacles
- Dreamer: trying to solve all the needs of the users
- Robot: only consideres technical solutions
- Octopus: maps too many things instead of splitting into milestones
