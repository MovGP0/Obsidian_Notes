Given an matrix and set of vectors, the vectors who are not rotated by the matrix are the eigenvectors.

When eigenvectors and eigenvalues are imaginary, then every non-zero vector will change when the matrix is applied.

Eigenvalue is the scaling of a vector that is in the same direction as the eigenvector.
