Formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687.

## Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)

**Description**
A body at rest remains at rest and a body in uniform motion remains in uniform motion along a geodesic unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force.

**Alternate Description**
There exists a set of inertial reference frames relative to which all particles with no net force acting on them will move without change in their velocity.
A body persists in a state of rest or of uniform motion unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force.

## Newton's Second Law

**Description**
When observed from an inertial reference frame, the net force on a particle is equal to the time rate of change of its linear momentum: 
$$F = \frac{d}{dt}(mv)$$

**Alternate Description**
When mass is constant, force equals mass times acceleration:
$$F = ma$$ 

The net force on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:
$$F_{\text{net}} = \frac{d}{dt} p$$
$$F = ma$$

## Newton's Third Law

**Description**
To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Alternate Description**
Whenever a particle A exerts a force on another particle B, B simultaneously exerts a force on A with the same magnitude in the opposite direction.

## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation (Newton's 4th Law)

Every point mass attracts every single other point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both points. The force is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the point masses.

$$F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

Where
  - $F$ is the gravitational force between the two masses.
  - $G$ is the gravitational constant ($G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$).
  - $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the two masses.
  - $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.
