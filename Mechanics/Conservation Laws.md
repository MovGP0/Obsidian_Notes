| Conservation of Energy                                      | Energy             | Derived from time translational symmetry. There are situations where it's useful to divide energy into potential and kinetic.                                                                            |
| [[Conservation of Linear Momentum]]                             | Linear Momentum    | Derived from spatial translational symmetry. Holds in the absence of external forces.                                                                                                                    |
| Conservation of Angular Momentum                            | Angular Momentum   | Derived from rotational symmetry. Holds in the absence of external torques.                                                                                                                              |
| Conservation of Electric Charge                             | Electric Charge    | Charges can't be created or destroyed, only separated or combined.                                                                                                                                       |
| Conservation of Color Charge                                | Color Charge       | Relevant in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the study of strong interactions among quarks and gluons.                                                                                                      |
| Conservation of Baryon Number                               | Baryon Number      | Baryons (like protons and neutrons) have a baryon number of +1. Anti-baryons have -1. This number is conserved in known reactions.                                                                       |
| Conservation of Lepton Number                               | Lepton Number      | Leptons (like electrons, muons, and neutrinos) have a lepton number of +1. Anti-leptons have -1. This number is conserved separately for each lepton flavor (electron, muon, tau) in the Standard Model. |
| Conservation of Isospin                                     | Isospin            | Used in the study of the strong interactions. Less exact than some of the other conservation laws.                                                                                                       |
| Conservation of Parity (violated in some weak interactions) | Parity             | Parity describes the transformation that inverts the spatial coordinates (reflection). It's conserved in electromagnetic, strong, and gravitational interactions but not in certain weak interactions.   |
| Conservation of CPT (Charge, Parity, Time reversal)         | CPT                | Stems from quantum field theory. Every known physical process is invariant under the combined operation of CPT.                                                                                          |
