The Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom is then given by:

$$\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V} + \hat{H}_{\text{rel}} + \hat{H}_{\text{so}} + \hat{H}_{\text{D}} + \hat{H}_{\text{hf}}$$

## Kinetic Energy Term

$$\hat{T} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2$$

This term represents the kinetic energy of the electron. Here, $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the electron-proton system, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

## Potential Energy Term

$$\hat{V} = -\frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}$$

This term describes the Coulomb attraction between the electron and proton, where $r$ is the distance between them, $e$ is the charge of the electron, and $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.

## Fine Structure

The fine structure accounts for relativistic corrections and spin-orbit interaction. It consists of three main terms:

### Relativistic Kinetic Energy Correction

$$\hat{H}_{\text{rel}} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{8\mu^2 c^2}\nabla^4$$

###  Spin-Orbit Interaction

$$\hat{H}_{\text{so}} = \frac{e\hbar}{2\mu c^2 r}\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{S}$$

where $\mathbf{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum, and $\mathbf{S}$ is the spin of the electron.

### Darwin Term

$$\hat{H}_{\text{D}} = \frac{e^2\hbar^2}{8\mu c^2\epsilon_0}\delta(\mathbf{r})$$

## Hyperfine Structure

The hyperfine structure is due to the interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear magnetic moment. It is given by:

$$\hat{H}_{\text{hf}} = \frac{A}{2} \mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{S}$$

where $A$ is the hyperfine coupling constant, and $\mathbf{I}$ is the nuclear spin.
