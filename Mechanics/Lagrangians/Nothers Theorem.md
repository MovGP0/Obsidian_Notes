Formulated by the mathematician Emmy Noether in 1915.

The theorem states that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. 

If the system's Lagrangian remains unchanged under a continuous transformation (a symmetry), there will be a corresponding conserved quantity.

| Symmetry                               | Conservation Law              | Description                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time translation (time invariance)     | Energy conservation           | If the Lagrangian does not explicitly depend on time, the energy of the system is conserved.                        |
| Spatial translation (space invariance) | Momentum conservation         | If the Lagrangian does not depend on a particular coordinate, the corresponding component of momentum is conserved. |
| Rotation (rotational invariance)       | Angular momentum conservation | If the system is invariant under rotations, the angular momentum is conserved.                                      |
| Phase invariance in quantum mechanics  | Charge conservation           | In the context of quantum mechanics, phase invariance leads to the conservation of electric charge.                 |
