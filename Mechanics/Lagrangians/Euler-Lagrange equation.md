The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived from the principle of stationary action, which states that the action $S$ (defined as the integral of the Lagrangian over time) is stationary for the true path taken by the system.

Given a Lagrangian function $L$ that depends on generalized coordinates $q$, their time derivatives $\dot{q}$, and possibly time $t$, the Euler-Lagrange equation is given by:

$$\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0$$

Where:
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}$ is the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the generalized velocity $\dot{q}_i$.
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}$ is the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the generalized coordinate $q_i$.
- $\frac{d}{dt}$ represents the time derivative.
- $i$ is an index that runs over the number of generalized coordinates.
