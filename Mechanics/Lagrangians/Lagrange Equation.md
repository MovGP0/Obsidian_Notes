$$L = T - V = E_{kin} - E_{pot}$$

## Kinetic Energy $T$

The kinetic energy is associated with motion. 

For a single particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$, the kinetic energy is given by:
$$T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$$

## Potential Energy $V$

The energy associated with the configuration or position of the system. 

In a gravitational field, an object at a height $h$ has a gravitational potential energy given by $V = mgh$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

Potential energy can also arise from other [[Elementary Forces]].
