## Strong Force (Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD)

- Governs the interactions between quarks and gluons.
- Responsible for binding quarks together to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons.
- Described by the exchange of gluons.
- Color charge conservation: The total color charge of an isolated system remains constant.

## Electromagnetic Force (Quantum Electrodynamics, QED)

- Governs the interactions between charged particles.
- Described by the exchange of photons.
- Electric charge conservation: The total electric charge of an isolated system remains constant.

## Weak Force

- Responsible for processes like beta decay in atomic nuclei.
- Mediated by W and Z bosons.
- Flavor changes can occur in weak interactions; for instance, a down quark can change to an up quark.

## Gravity (General Relativity)

- Affects all objects with mass or energy.
- Not yet fully integrated into the quantum framework (a theory of quantum gravity is still sought).
- Described in general relativity by the curvature of spacetime in the presence of mass and energy.
